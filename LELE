#   ORDERER
#
#   This section defines the values to encode into a config transaction or
#   genesis block for orderer related parameters.

################################################################################
Orderer: &OrdererDefaults
  # Orderer Type: The orderer implementation to start.
  # Available types are "etcdraft" and "BFT".
  # Please note that "solo" and "kafka" are no longer supported.
  OrdererType: etcdraft

  # Addresses used to be the list of orderer addresses that clients and peers
  # could connect to.  However, this does not allow clients to associate orderer
  # addresses and orderer organizations which can be useful for things such
  # as TLS validation.  The preferred way to specify orderer addresses is now
  # to include the OrdererEndpoints item in your org definition
  Addresses:
    # - 127.0.0.1:7050

  # Batch Timeout: The amount of time to wait before creating a batch.
  BatchTimeout: 2s

  # Batch Size: Controls the number of messages batched into a block.
  # The orderer views messages opaquely, but typically, messages may
  # be considered to be Fabric transactions.  The 'batch' is the group
  # of messages in the 'data' field of the block.  Blocks will be a few kb
  # larger than the batch size, when signatures, hashes, and other metadata
  # is applied.
  BatchSize:
    # Max Message Count: The maximum number of messages to permit in a
    # batch.  No block will contain more than this number of messages.
    MaxMessageCount: 500

    # Absolute Max Bytes: The absolute maximum number of bytes allowed for
    # the serialized messages in a batch. The maximum block size is this value
    # plus the size of the associated metadata (usually a few KB depending
    # upon the size of the signing identities). Any transaction larger than
    # this value will be rejected by ordering.
    # It is recommended not to exceed 49 MB, given the default grpc max message size of 100 MB
    # configured on orderer and peer nodes (and allowing for message expansion during communication).
    AbsoluteMaxBytes: 10 MB

    # Preferred Max Bytes: The preferred maximum number of bytes allowed
    # for the serialized messages in a batch. Roughly, this field may be considered
    # the best effort maximum size of a batch. A batch will fill with messages
    # until this size is reached (or the max message count, or batch timeout is
    # exceeded).  If adding a new message to the batch would cause the batch to
    # exceed the preferred max bytes, then the current batch is closed and written
    # to a block, and a new batch containing the new message is created.  If a
    # message larger than the preferred max bytes is received, then its batch
    # will contain only that message.  Because messages may be larger than
    # preferred max bytes (up to AbsoluteMaxBytes), some batches may exceed
    # the preferred max bytes, but will always contain exactly one transaction.
    PreferredMaxBytes: 2 MB

  # Max Channels is the maximum number of channels to allow on the ordering
  # network. When set to 0, this implies no maximum number of channels.
  MaxChannels: 0

  # ConsenterMapping contains the definition of consenter identity, endpoints, and crypto material.
  # The ConsenterMapping is used in the BFT consensus protocol, and should include enough servers to ensure
  # fault-tolerance; In BFT this number is at least 3*F+1, where F is the number of potential failures.
  # In BFT it is highly recommended that the addresses for delivery & broadcast (the OrdererEndpoints item in the
  # org definition) map 1:1 to the Orderer/ConsenterMapping (for cluster consensus). That is, every consenter should
  # be represented by a delivery endpoint. Note that in BFT (V3) global Orderer/Addresses are no longer supported.
